  This config has two [scheduled workflows](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/workflows/): `monitor-every-minute` and `monitor-siren-test`.
  The `monitor-every-minute` workflow has been configured to run every minute. This monitor is set up to alert
  Slack if there have been more than 5 pipelines triggered by any given user or more than 10 pipelines for the whole
  repository in the past 60 seconds.
  The `monitor-siren-test` workflow has been configured at midnight on the first day of every month.
  The alert thresholds have been set to 0 to force a trigger, and `siren-test` has been set to `true` so that alerts will be prefaced with the text "THIS IS JUST A TEST".
